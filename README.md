# Employee-Salary_Prediction-
In this project, we developed a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee earns more than 50K based on demographic and job-related attributes. This end-to-end system includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
